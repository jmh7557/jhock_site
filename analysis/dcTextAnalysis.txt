After generating a corpus for the “DC text”, I was able to gather that this text is from Dr. Seward’s diary. The most popular 3 word NGrams were “I could see”, “I could not”, and Dr Van Helsing. Just based off these NGrams, I could guess something along the lines of Frankenstein or Dracula. As well, the “I could see” and “I could not” show that in the diary there are observations being made. When looking at the 4 word NGrams, Dr Seward and Jonathan Harker are mentioned several times also indicating characters within Dracula. When looking at the 5 word NGrams, September and October are frequently mentioned which indicates that the timeline takes place in the fall, more specifically, the time leading up to Halloween. First thing I noticed when looking through Voyant, is that “said” is the most frequently used word. This means within this text there is much dialogue between the characters.
