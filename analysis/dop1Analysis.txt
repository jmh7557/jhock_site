After using both Antconc and Voyant, I was able to take a text that I never read and develop a general analysis. A N-Gram that came frequent throughout the ext was “Woodbury’s facial powder”. The most popular single words were the names of Gail, Olsen, and Dan. It was interesting how don’t was by far the most frequent 2 word N-Gram but was not shown in Voyant as it was seen as a stop word. If I had to take my best guess on what the text was, I’d think it was a formal of script for an advertisement for Woodbury facial products, more specifically their facial powder.
