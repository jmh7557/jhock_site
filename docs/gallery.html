                <p>This picture was taken the summer of 2021 when we were helping my sister move in her new apartment.
                    She moved to Hoboken after she graduated from Binghamton University and is now doing her masters at their
                    Manhattan Campus. Hoboken is a really cool town, as there arent any tall buldings like a city, but everything 
                    is within walking distance. I thought it was so cool there, that ive been to visit her several times in less than a year.</p>
