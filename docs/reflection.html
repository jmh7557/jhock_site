        In my Reflection of doing both versions of creating websites, I have learned many different ways
        to change a website through code and by using tools on a site. Significant Challenges to a new learner is that there is alot of trial and error. 
        In order to get your code to work, there will be many failures until you create the correct code.
        It will be hard to not get discouraged but there are many helpul tools and resources to get through the process.
        An advantage using Oxygen and html code is the room for more customization. Alothough you are more likely to get errors, with practice, you can create a site almost exactly to your likening.
        I think one of the best comparison would be making cookie dough from scratch and buying premade dough.
